If it is an executable it will run in a new shell.\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\n`open` is now the deprecated `opn` package. Upgrading to the latest version is likely have unwanted effects since it now has a very different API but will prevent this vulnerability.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-28xh-wpgr-7fm8"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":0,"high":0,"critical":1},"dependencies":1,"devDependencies":0,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":1}}
